# <a name="description"/>Description 
  A Java desktop GUI program that shows an animation of a sorting algorithm in action. Through our application, you will get to learn how to sort algorithms such as, Bubble Sorting, and Insertion Sorting, Binary Searching.

# <a name="Whyuseourapp"/>Why Use Our Application
  Our application have some unique options such as
  
    * Color blind mode
    * Start/Stop
    * Speed Control
    * Edit Data Set
    * Text Color Customization
    

# Sorting Algorithms
## <a name="BubbleSort"/>Bubble Sort  
  Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. Bubble sort can be practical if the input is in mostly sorted order with some out-of-order elements nearly in position.

## <a name="InsertionSort"/>Insertion Sort
  Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain

# <a name="Installation"/>Installation

   steps to install the app:

# <a name="Howtouse"/>How To Use
## front page
   here you will find a textbar with a pre-sellected data set OR type a data set, then Click on the Algorithm that you would like to learn.
   
## Setting
   on the front page you will also find a button for Setting. in there you will be able to customize how the app should look that. you will be able to customize the color of the font. Turn On/Off Color Blind Mode, and size of the font.
## Inside Sorting Algorithms
   here the User will be able to visually learn the selected algorithm. the user will also be able to speed up/ slow down the process to get a better understanding of the algorithm. their is a pause/play button which will help the user take their time learning it. the use will also be able to Edit the data set by adding or deleting a number from the set, and all of this can be done right there on the learning page.
