# <a name="description"/>Description 
  A Java desktop GUI program that shows an animation of a sorting algorithm in action. Through our application, you will get to learn how to sort algorithms such as, Bubble Sorting, and Insertion Sorting. The array size and execution speed can be customized by the user.

  Our application have some unique options such as
  
    * Color blind mode
    * Start/Stop
    * Speed Control
    * Edit Data Set

## Bubble Sort  
  Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. Bubble sort can be practical if the input is in mostly sorted order with some out-of-order elements nearly in position.

## Insertion Sort
  Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain
